# Partial Fractions and Laplace/Inverse Laplace calculator
This is a calculator program I made while being bored doing Advanced Calculus.. Feel free to try it out.. It calculates Partial fractions and gives Laplace and Inverse Laplace transformed output for any input f(t) and F(s) respectively(that is laplace(f(t)) and inverselaplace(F(s)) just by inputting the function!!) .. ðŸ˜„
